# The branding

Rigs of Rods is a soft-body physics simulator aiming to be as realistic as possible. Everything we do is free and open source to the general public. That said, we take branding seriously and maintain a quality. Please do not edit, change, distort, recolor, or reconfigure the Rigs of Rods logo.
